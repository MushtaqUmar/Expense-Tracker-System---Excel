# Expense-Tracker-System - Excel
Welcome to my Personal Expense Tracker, built entirely in Excel. This system is designed for anyone who wants a simple yet effective way to track their income and expenses throughout the year, without needing to install complex software or apps.

**Project Overview**
This tracker is divided into two sheets:

ðŸ”¹ *Sheet 1 â€“ Income-Expense*
This is the working sheet where you log your day-to-day income and expenses.
It has two clear sections/Tables:

Income â€“ Date-wise record of any income source like salary, side income, or investment returns.

Expenses â€“ Daily record of all your spending, categorized for better tracking and insights.

ðŸ”¹ *Sheet 2 â€“ Tracker System*
This is where the magic happens...

Auto-tracks your income and expenses based on data in Sheet 1.

Visualizes your financial summary with:

- Pie charts for expense category contribution and overall income vs expenses

- Icons for quick category understanding with numbers tracking Income and Expenses.

- A date-range filter to track expenses for any specific period of the year (for example I want track my income-expense from March to July only)

- Displays total income vs total expenses, with automated calculation of what's spent and whatâ€™s saved.
